Advanced React Patterns

- [Implement higher-order components (HOCs) to reuse component logic and enhance component behaviour](https://react-advance-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/hoc)
- [Utilize the render props pattern to share code between components and pass data or functionality as props](https://react-advance-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/renderProps)
- [Design compound components to create a more flexible and cohesive API for component composition](https://react-advance-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/compoundComponent)
- [Understand the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components and use the appropriate approach in different scenarios](https://react-advance-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/controlled)(https://react-advance-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/uncontrolled)
- [Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React components gracefully](https://react-advance-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/errorBondry)
- [Leverage advanced features of the Context API to manage state or share data across components effectively](https://react-advance-cource.vercel.app/login)
- [Use portals to render components outside the normal component hierarchy, such as modals or overlays.](https://react-advance-cource.vercel.app//advancedReactPatterns/portals)


Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with React

- Configure and set up a server-side rendering environment for a React application
- Utilize React's server-side rendering API to render React components on the server
- Implement data fetching and hydration on the server to provide pre-rendered content to clients
- Handle routing and navigation in a server-side rendered application, ensuring proper server-side rendering for each route
- Implement performance optimization and caching strategies specific to server-side rendering to improve application performance
