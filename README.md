## Advanced React Patterns

- [Implement higher-order components (HOCs) to reuse component logic and enhance component behaviour](https://urvil-react-advance-project.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/hoc)
- [Utilize the render props pattern to share code between components and pass data or functionality as props](https://urvil-react-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/renderProps)
- [Design compound components to create a more flexible and cohesive API for component composition](https://urvil-react-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/compoundComponent)
- [Understand the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components and use the appropriate approach in different scenarios](https://urvil-react-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/controlled)
- [Understand the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components and use the appropriate approach in different scenarios](https://urvil-react-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/uncontrolled)
- [Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors in React components gracefully](https://urvil-react-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/errorBondry)
- [Leverage advanced features of the Context API to manage state or share data across components effectively](https://urvil-react-cource.vercel.app/login)
- [Use portals to render components outside the normal component hierarchy, such as modals or overlays.](https://urvil-react-cource.vercel.app/advancedReactPatterns/portals)
